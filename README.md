## Generate a Fernet Key
We've made it easier for you by creating a custom Django command to quickly generate a fernet key, which is a *crucial component* in the authentication system. Make sure to keep the key secure and store it somewhere safely (ie: environment variable). 

**Important ‚õîÔ∏è** : You should treat the `FERNET_KEY` security at the same level as the Django `SECRET_KEY`. ü´°

To generate the fernet key use the following command:

```python
python manage.py generate_fernet_key
```
or 
```python
django-admin generate_fernet_key
```
